# (Work In Progress) Math-Game-Mobile-Application-Fun-Project-
I was curious about mobile application development so I decided to embark on making a simple maths table practice application for mobile devices

### First code created
A simple squares MCQ game to test basic functionality and theories. In addition to testing the Github environment for coding and updating.
